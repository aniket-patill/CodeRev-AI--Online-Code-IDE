# Forced Creation Flow ✅

## What Changed

Per your request ("plan was to make sure user create a space then make them create"), we have updated the tour to strongly encourage creation actions.

### 1. **Dashboard: Encouraging Space Creation**
- **Last Step**: Renamed to "**Start Building**".
- **Action**: Points directly to the "Create Workspace" button with the prompt: "Ready to launch? Click here to create your first workspace."

### 2. **Workspace: Encouraging File Creation**
- **New Step**: Added "**Create a File**" immediately after the File Explorer step.
- **Action**: Spotlights the **File Button** (`<File />` icon) in the sidebar.
- **Message**: "Start by creating a new file. Click this button to add your first code file to the project."

## How to Test

1. **Dashboard Tour**: Notice the final step leads you to the Create button.
2. **Workspace Tour**: After viewing the Left Panel, the tour will specifically highlight the **"File" button** to prompt file creation.
