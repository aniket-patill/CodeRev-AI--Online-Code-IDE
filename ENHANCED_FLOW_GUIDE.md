# Enhanced Guidance & Continuity ✅

## What Changed

### 1. **Explicit Next Steps (Dashboard)**
- Updated "Start Building" step.
- **New Text**: "Click to create your first workspace. You'll name it, choose visibility, and click Create. We'll verify your setup and **continue the tour inside**!"
- This explicitly tells the user the experience doesn't end here.

### 2. **Action-Driven Instructions (Workspace)**
- Updated "Create a File" step.
- **New Text**: "Let's write some code! Click this button to create your first file (e.g., index.js) and see the editor in action."
- This serves as a direct call to action ("make them create").

### 3. **The Complete Flow**
- **Dashboard**: Welcome -> Explain Tabs -> Point to Create -> **Promise Continuity**.
- **Action**: User creates space -> Redirects.
- **Workspace**: Auto-starts -> Explains Interface -> **Points to 'Create File'** -> Points to Collaboration -> Points to Git.

## How to Test

1. **Dashboard**: Read the last step text.
2. **Workspace**: Read the specific instruction on the creation step.
