# Added Collaboration Tour Step ✅

## What Changed

Per your request, I added a specific step to highlight the **Invite/Collaboration** feature in the workspace.

### 1. **New Tour Step**
- **Title**: Real-time Collaboration
- **Description**: "Invite team members to code with you in real-time. Share your workspace and build together."
- **Position**: Appears immediately after the "Output & Documentation" step, highlighting the member icons in the top-right.

### 2. **Targeting**
- Added `id="invite-members-btn"` to the member list container in both **Focus** and **Learning** workspaces.
- This ensures the spotlight lands precisely on the feature, making it "place really good".

## How to Test

1. Enter any Workspace.
2. Start the Tour.
3. Advance to **Step 4**.
4. You will see the spotlight highlight the **Members/Invite area** in the top header.
